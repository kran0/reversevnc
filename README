This software package is designed to simplify the procedures of 
configuring the end-users reverce vnc server.

The ideology is:
1 - Included software in the package must be free for personal use (at 
least).
2 - The package mustwork on many types of Windows servers and 
workstations.
3 - System and brain requirements to run client-side software (the 
reverce VNC server) must be extremely small.

THis package is creating for make the remote technical support much 
easy. Technical engineer must only run something like /vncviewer 
--listen/ an send prepared .exe package to user. All configurations 
must be hardcoded in the .exe

How does it work?
The very first variant of this program is running RealVNC as server and 
connects it sequencelly to remote vnc clients. This variant could 
optionally work through http(s) proxy server too.

Known issues.
Only console window of end user's PC could be shared.
Only http(s) proxies with CONNECT directive are supported in poxy mode.
